# 🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot using NLP (Python)

A **rule-based chatbot** developed using **Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
This project demonstrates core NLP fundamentals such as **tokenization, regular expressions, and pattern matching**, making it ideal for beginners exploring conversational AI.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Rule-Based Chatbot simulates human-like conversation by matching user inputs with predefined rules using **regular expressions**.  
Unlike machine-learning chatbots, this system relies on **deterministic logic**, making it fast, interpretable, and lightweight.

This project is designed to showcase **NLP foundations** and **text processing skills** in a simple yet effective way.
